I’ve partnered with Derek on multiple design and UX projects. I’ve always been impressed by the quality of his work, his broad knowledge in both design and development, and his excellent communication skills. 

Derek’s design decisions command great respect, but he is also an excellent listener and ready to adjust his visions to meet client needs. I would not hesitate to enlist Derek as a UX strategist or designer on any project.
