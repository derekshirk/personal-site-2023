Derek is one of the most outstanding designers I've worked with. He is known for his thought leadership and investments in growing those around him. Derek is a fierce design leader wrapped in a friendly humble package.

<!-- No matter the role, Derek delivers innovative design solutions and is passionate about mentoring designers and teaching them the tools they need to exceed. 

I managed Derek directly when he was a Lead Product Designer on the Shop team and later I collaborated with Derek when he became a Principal Product Designer supporting my Revenue Design teams.

so much so that he was selected to propose a design strategy for merchandising new and used cars together to the CEO of Lithia Motors. No surprise, Derek nailed the presentation and his proposal is the shopping experience you see on Driveway.com today.  Derek has hosted countless Figma workshops and had generated templates and guidelines to help designers get the most out of their creative tools. Yet, my favorite thing that Derek teaches is how to give and receive useful design feedback. Critique is a shared team exercise. Derek is co-led an initiative with Tyler Davis to help designers practice better communication and collaboration habits- skills that will far outlast any one design tool.  I look forward to watching him speak at a future design conference! -->
