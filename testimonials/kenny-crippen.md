Derek is a rare breed with many talents, including design, web development, and creative direction. He is also excellent with clients and consistently able to produce solutions that exceed their expectations.

I've worked with Derek on multiple occasions. In one role, he was my direct supervisor. His communication and feedback were always kind, patient, and professional. I could always count on him to help move the project forward for the better. If I had the opportunity, I would jump at the chance to work with Derek again.
