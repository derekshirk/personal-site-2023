Derek is a rare breed with many talents, including design, front-end development, and creative direction. His communication and feedback are always kind, patient, and professional. I could always count on him to help move the project forward for the better.

<!-- He is also excellent with clients and consistently able to produce solutions that exceed their expectations.

I've worked with Derek on multiple occasions. In one role, he was my direct supervisor. If I had the opportunity, I would jump at the chance to work with Derek again. -->
