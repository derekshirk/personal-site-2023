I worked with Derek on a multi-year project and enjoyed our time collaborating on user interface and design system tasks.

Derek is patient, an excellent listener, and a great teammate. He is open-minded and graceful at giving and receiving feedback. He always strives to design inclusive experiences and ensures the results find technical, functional, and visual harmony. I highly recommend Derek as he continues forward in his career.
