Derek is a talented designer and strategic problem solver. I enjoyed working with him at Cloud Four on various front-end and design system projects and was consistently impressed by the quality and creativity of his output.

Besides being talented at sketching, prototyping, and designing in the browser, he is also an experienced front-end developer and a masterful communicator. I would recommend Derek to anyone looking to fill a front-end design or strategic UX role.
