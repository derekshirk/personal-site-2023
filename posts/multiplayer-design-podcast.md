It has been a personal goal to start a podcast for a long time and I have finally put the idea into motion and am currently working on starting a podcast with a previous co-worker <a href="https://georgeclingandesign.com/" title="Personal website of George Clingan">George Clingan</a> 

We are just gettting started but are excited to share this show with the world. Here's our very first episode that we've recorded as an experiment.

## About the Show
The Multiplayer Design Podcast is a fortnightly show about design and designer culture by two product designers, George Clingan & me! The show will bring our listeners into our lives as product designers but the goal is to use our platform to share stories that relate to the broader spectrum of design and designer culture. 


## About the Name
Collaboration has always been at the heart of design however, the work from home and remote work landcape that exploded in 2020 has also shinned a light on new opportunities for more real time collaboration. Pair that with the popular multiplayer feature offered in the popular design tool Figma, and what it means to collaborate with fellow designers has been changed forever. We hope to pay homage what it means to work on a team and collaborate with other designers because as the saying goes, nothing great is designed alone.
