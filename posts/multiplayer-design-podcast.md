It has been a personal goal to start a podcast for a long time and I have finally put the idea into motion have now offically launched a podcast with a previous co-worker <a href="https://georgeclingandesign.com/" title="Personal website of George Clingan">George Clingan</a> 

We've recorded a few test pancakes, and are just gettting started but I'm excited to share this show with the world. You can listen to the Multiplayer Design anywhere you listen to podcasts.

## About the Show
The Multiplayer Design Podcast is a fortnightly show about design and designer culture by two product designers, George Clingan & me! The show will bring our listeners into our lives as product designers but the goal is to use our platform to share stories that relate to the broader spectrum of design and designer culture. 


## About the Name
Collaboration has always been at the heart of design. The remote work landcape that exploded in 2020 has also shinned a light on new opportunities for different types of digital real time collaboration. Pair that with the popular multiplayer feature offered in the popular design tool Figma, and what it means to collaborate with fellow designers has been changed forever. We hope to pay homage what it means to work on a team and collaborate with other designers because as the saying goes, nothing great is designed alone.
