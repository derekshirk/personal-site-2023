Portland, Oregon used to have a long standing a popular annual event called Portland Design Week. Unfortunately, Portland Design Week is no longer. You can read more about it [here](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/arts-and-culture/2021/11/design-week-portland-ends). 

About a year later and as COVIDâ€“19 restrictions were finally starting to be lifted another group of Portalnds launched a new event by the name of PDX Design Festival. It was the inagrual year for the event and my team at Driveway submitted a request to host [an event](https://portland.aiga.org/event/pdxdf-designing-the-ux-of-collaboration-for-better-digital-products/) at our headquarters in Tigard. 

This video is the recording of my opening talk titled Designing for Collaboration. The event way hybrid with a mix of in-person and remote participants.
