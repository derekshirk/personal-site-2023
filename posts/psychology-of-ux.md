24 hours before this event I had no idea I was going to be giving a lightning talk. That the way life goes sometimes. It was the week of the innogrual Innovation Week and Driveway. Remote teammates had flown into town, folks were meeting each other in personf for the first time and there were five days of fun activities, collaboration, and socializing. I was looking at the signups for the lighting talks and no one from the Experince Design team had signed up. 

At that moment I decided I should probably represent our team and give a talk. I only had to think of something to talk about for about five minutes â€“ easy, _right_?!

I had recently released my second Figma Community resource, the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1097041389562707610/%E2%9D%96-Laws-of-UX%3A-Reference-Cards">Laws of UX Components</a> Library. The topic of the Laws of UX was fresh in my mind so that's what I decided to talk about. 

It wasn't my by best and most well constructed talk, but it was fun nevertheless and I was happy to partipate in the event and represent the Experience Design team at Driveway's first ever Innovation week.
