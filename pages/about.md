I've been making and designing for more than 20 years. My work has shaped physical spaces, helped launch brands, programmed digital experiences, and designed both systems and digital products. I am currently working as a Principal Product Designer at [Driveway](https://driveway.com), where I’ve worked with Revenue and Fulfillment teams to simplify the end-to-end process of buying, selling, and financing vehicles 100% online. 

Around 2009, unique circumstances brought 10 young creatives together in co-working space within the walls of a local architecture firm. As a participant in that experiement, I helped evolve the studio and ultimatley co-found a small design agency that thrived until 2015 when my partner and I decide to sell and move on to other things.

I currently reside in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I put as much time into perfecting the craft of design as I do the art of life. When I’m not obsessing over design details, I love to be outdoors. I am recharged by running and surrounding myself with trees, soaking up some river vibes when the sun is hot and mountain vibes when the snow is deep.
