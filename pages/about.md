I've been practicing different mediums of design for more than 20 years. I’ve designed physical spaces, created brands, co-founded an agency, programmed websites, and designed digital products. I am currently working as a Principal Product Designer at Driveway, Where I’ve worked with Revenue and Fulfillment teams to design new features, elevate craft, improve design maturity and foster collaboration across the entire team. 

Around 2010, I co-founded a small design agency that formed after unique circumstances brought 10 Portland based designers together in a co-working space within the walls of a local architecture firm.  The studio thrived until 2015 when my partner and I decide to sell and move on to other things.  It’s a decent story, ask me about it sometime. 

I currently reside in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. 
I prioritize growth in my professional and personal life and put as much time into perfecting the craft of design as I do the art of life. When I’m not obsessing over design details, I love to be outdoors. Running and surrounding myself with trees, river vibes in the summer and snow vibes in the winter.
