## How I handle your data

This website does not collect any personal data. It does not set any cookies and it does not use any third-party tracking scripts. No user analytics or other metrics are processed during your visit.


## Secure data transfer

This website is transmited using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider may still be able to see that you are accessing files from this website, but not the contents of what your viewing. HTTPS also protects you from third parties intercepting data e.g. while browsing on public WiFi, or network providers injecting ads.
